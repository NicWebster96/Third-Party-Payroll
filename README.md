# CPSC 301 Section 1, Spring 2019

## Nicholas Webster

### Project 3
The provided text file lists first and last name, employee ID, company name, hours worked, and hourly wage. A class was utilized to store all the record information. The person.h header file contained all function declarations and the person.cpp contains the definitions. Pay.cpp used a vector to handle the employees. A second vector was used for the company names and duplicate company names were removed. Output text files were made for each individual company and listed all employees of that company.
